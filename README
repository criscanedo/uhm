u have mail
===========

uhm is a tiny C daemon, written in 50 lines of code, that plays an audio file
whenever new mail arrives.

By default uhm uses OpenBSD's aucat(1) utility to playback the specified audio
file whenever the specified user's system mailbox grows in size. Realistically,
any file can be watched for growth it doesn't have to be a mailbox, though this
is what I use it for and why I wrote it.

Configuration
-------------

uhm does not process any options or arguments so as to encourage the new
programmer to hack the program themselves to specify which mailbox to watch,
which audio file to play, and even which audio utility to use. This can all be
changed in a few keystrokes. The ambitious newbie programmer may even take this
opportunity to implement use of getopt(3).

I have, however, provided a patch alongside the source that contains this
functionality, namely options to specify a mailbox, audio file, and the
interval, in milliseconds, at which uhm checks the mailbox for new mail. The
default interval is 1/10 of a second (100 ms).

The patch was generated with git-format-patch(1) and can therefore be applied
with git-am(1):

    $ git am getopt.diff

Install
-------

    $ make
    # make install

Run
---

    $ uhm

It's best to launch this automatically at boot time from a Unix rc.d(8) script.
An example OpenBSD rc.d(8) sript is provided.

You can sample the audio file I personally use by retrieving it from
satorii.org's gopherhole:

    $ sacc satorii.org/9/audio/mail.wav >mail.wav
    $ curl gopher://satorii.org/9/audio/mail.wav >mail.wav
    $ echo "/audio/mail.wav" | nc satorii.org 70 >mail.wav
