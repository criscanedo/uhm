u have mail
===========

uhm is a tiny C program, originally written in 45 lines of code,
that plays a WAV encoded audio file, using OpenBSD's aucat(1)
utility, whenever new mail arrives to the user's system mailbox,
usually /var/mail/user.

The program was intended to be a primitive solution for a sudden idea that came
to mind. It works and it does what I need it to do on my system. If I need
anything more, I'll add it. If you need anything more, you'll add it. The
program does not process any arguments or options supplied by the user to
specify which mailbox to monitor or which audio file to play. This was
intentional so as to encourage new programmers to hack the source themselves
and point the program to the correct files on their system. It also serves as
an exercise to implement option processing with getopt(3). Either way, a patch
will be provided alongside the source to be quickly applied for this
functionality.

Install
-------

Be sure you change `mbox` and `aud` to appropriate paths in uhm.c.

    $ make
    # make install

Run
---

    $ uhm

It's best to launch this automatically at boot time from a Unix rc.d(8) script.
